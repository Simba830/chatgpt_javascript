# chatgpt-action

Let chatgpt review your PR.

Please noteï¼š this repo is a WIP and I do not recommend you to use it in production!

## Warning

- code of experimental quality!
- ChatGPT often generates misleading comments which could confuse your contributors and that's
one reason against using this action in production.
- Sometimes you will get 403 errors when the generated prompt is too long or considered an attack(perhaps?). 
  - ~~Split the prompt and let ChatGPT comment on every single file should resolve this issue.~~ This feature has been implemented but it is unstable. Add `split: true` to `with` node in your config to enable this feature.
